"Mochi cats" are cute illustration of two cats, often doing couple things or displaying various emotions. They are commonly used as stickers in apps like WhatsApp. 

This app targets the WhatsApp stickers. It is based on [WhatsApp Sticker App Template]([https://github.com/original-author/original-repo-name](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers)) but adds functionality for changing the colors of the stickers, and thereby their implied gender, as well as a pack of new stickers created by me.
